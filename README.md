This is an "intro to git" assignment for Math 607.

Clone this repository using "git clone".  Then pretend it's a paper you're writing.

1. Make a version that's ready to go on the arXiv.  Add a bibliography. 

2. As you fix errors, add files, and so forth, keep the repository up to date with the commands "git add" and "git commit".

3. Make a horrible mistake, save it, and use "git reset" to undo what you've done.

4. Your paper is now on the arXiv.  Make an "arxiv branch" of your repository with "git branch", so that even if you change other stuff, you've got the source code for the version of your article which everybody uses.

5. You decide to submit the paper to an Elsevier journal, which requires you to use elsarticle instead of amsart.  You prefer the way your paper looked originally, though, so you decide to leave the arxiv version the way it is.  Make a "journal" branch with "git branch".


6. The journal refuses to publish the appendix of your paper because it's too long.  Delete the appendix from the journal version only.

7. Your colleague points out that 51 is not a prime number, and perhaps another couple of subtle errors.   Update both versions of your paper.
8. You find some more errors.  Change them in all versions of the document.
